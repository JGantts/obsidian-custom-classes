# How to contribute ?

## Contribute by _**testing**_ Custom Classes
1) Test the plugin's features
2) Observe a bug or an improvement that could be made
3) Report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/LilaRest/obsidian-custom-classes/issues/new)

## Contribute by _**coding**_ Custom Classes
- If you have found a bug or a potential improvement for the plugin and want to code it, I would be happy to accept your PRs!
  **Important :** It'd be good to talk about it beforehand to make sure that no one else is working on it. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/LilaRest/obsidian-custom-classes/issues/new) for this.
- If you want to code but don't know where to start :
  1) Check out the issues labelled "[help wanted](https://github.com/LilaRest/obsidian-custom-classes/labels/help%20wanted)".
  2) Check out ~~our roadmap~~ (not available yet) and choose an unassigned task

**Here are the steps to contribute to the Custom Classes's code :**
1) Fork this repository
2) Clone your fork on your computer using `git clone https://github.com/<YourGithubName>/obsidian-custom-classes.git`
3) In local, navigate into the cloned folder called `obsidian-custom-classes/`
4) Add the _Custom Classes_ project repository as the "upstream" remote using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/LilaRest/obsidian-custom-classes.git`
5) Now you can easily pull the new updates on the _Custom Classes_ repository using `git pull upstream main`
6) Perform changes to your local repository
7) Commit your changes using `git add -A` + `git commit -m "<YourChangesDescription>"`
8) Push your changes to your fork repository using `git push origin main`
9) Return to your fork page on Github, refresh the page and you should see an highlighted area that invites you to initiate a Pull Request. (alternatively you can click on the "New pull request" button)
